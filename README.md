  # Youssef Samy
  HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Youssef Samy, a computer & electronics engineering student based in Egypt.

  # ABOUT

  Student at University of Alexandria, (representative of) class of 2028, pursuing a major in Computer & Communications Engineering. Mathematician at heart, an engineer by noradrenaline deficiency. My love for electronics started ever since I was a kid, computer and mechanics have always been a side effect. My love for physics [and to a lesser extent, chemistry] was also a side effect of my love for electronics and mechanics. As a result, most of what I do with computers to computers is at the lower level, and the remainder of my passion for math and algorithms creeps its way into the higher level work and programming I do.\
  Deeply interested in the sustainability and efficiency of programs and electronics, including possible reimaginations of encryption software, computer & CPU architecture, transistor technology, thermodynamics at the electronics level (like the effect it may have on cells, capacitors and semi and superconductors), and how storage devices are used.\
  Bit of a boring nerd most of the time, might as well have office hours for if you want to talk to me so you think twice before putting yourself in a convo about some niche brainy things. When that's not the case, I have the most brain-damage-inducing fun and make cool memories.

  ## Academic Interests
  I'm currently studying a few subjects and working on others. Here are a few of the things I'm currently doing or planning on doing.
  
  Self-studying [Might pursue academically later on\]:\
  General Mechanics & Thermodynamics | Useless mathematics | Quantum Computing, Cryptography & Comp. Sci. | ML, Economics & Philosophy

  Academically studying:\
  Computer & Communications Engineering | Electronics Engineering

  ## Special Thanks To
  A lot of people contributed to my intellectual & career development. I'll show a limited selection of those who contributed to things relevant to what you'll see on my profile here.
